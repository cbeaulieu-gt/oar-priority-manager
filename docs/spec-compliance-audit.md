### §7.4 Center Pane — Priority Stacks

| Requirement | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| One section per animation | ✅ | Loops over `sm.animations`. |
| **Sections expandable with ▾/▸ toggle** | ❌ MISSING | Header shows static `▾` but clicking does nothing. No collapse/expand logic. No toggle state tracking. |

| **Formatted view: complex nesting fallback note** | ❌ MISSING | |
| **Raw JSON view** | ✅ | Pretty-printed JSON in read-only QTextEdit. |

|---|---|---|
| Detect AND/OR/NOT keywords in search | ❌ MISSING | No detection logic in search_bar.py. |

| Help tooltip when condition mode activates | ❌ MISSING | |

### §7.7 Advanced Filter Builder

| Requirement | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Modal dialog with three pill buckets | ✅ | `FilterBuilder` composes three `BucketWidget`s (Required / Any Of / Excluded) with Apply, Clear, Cancel buttons. |
| REQUIRED (green) / ANY OF (yellow) / EXCLUDED (red) | ✅ | `PillWidget` + `BucketWidget` implemented; dialog wired to `MainWindow._apply_advanced_filter` via `filter_applied` signal. |

## §8 — Persistence

### §8.1 OAR Overrides

- ✅ Writes to MO2 Overwrite at mirrored path
- ✅ Writes `user.json` (not `config.json`)
- ✅ Never writes to source mod paths

### §8.1.1 Override Provenance

- ✅ `_oarPriorityManager` metadata injected by serializer
- ✅ `override_is_ours` field on SubMod populated during scan
- ❌ **EXTERNAL OVERRIDE badge in UI** — not shown in details panel when overwrite user.json lacks tool metadata

### §8.2 Clear Overrides

| Requirement | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Clear Overrides button (per-mod scope)** | ❌ MISSING | `clear_override()` exists in `override_manager.py` but no UI button anywhere triggers it. |

### §8.3 Tool Config

| Spec field | AppConfig field | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `relative_or_absolute` | ✅ Present | ⚠️ Not loaded/applied to stacks panel on startup |
| `submod_sort` | ✅ Present | ⚠️ Not loaded/applied to tree panel on startup |
| `window_geometry` | ✅ Present | ⚠️ Not restored on startup (no `restoreGeometry` call) |
| `splitter_positions` | ✅ Present | ⚠️ Not restored on startup |
| `search_history` | ✅ Present | ⚠️ Not used anywhere |
| `last_selected_path` | ✅ Present | ⚠️ Not restored on startup |

**Config is saved on shutdown** (`save_config` called after `app.exec()`), but **none of the config values are applied during UI construction** — the app always starts in default state. Config values are also never updated from UI state before saving, so the saved file is always the defaults.

### §8.3.1 Instance Root Detection

- ✅ `--mods-path` CLI argument (primary)
- ✅ CWD contains `ModOrganizer.ini` (fallback)
- ✅ Walk up from CWD (fallback)
- ✅ Hard error with descriptive message
- ❌ **Manual directory picker dialog on failure** — spec says "dialog includes a directory picker as a last-resort manual override". Code raises `DetectionError` and prints to stderr, exits with return code 1. No dialog.
- ❌ **`%APPDATA%/oar-priority-manager/last-instance.json` persistence** — not implemented.

---

## §9 — Error Handling

| Requirement | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Load with warnings (don't abort scan) | ✅ | Parser returns warnings, scanner collects them. |
| ⚠ icon on warning items | ✅ | In tree. |
| **Edits blocked on warning items** | ❌ MISSING | Action buttons don't check `has_warnings`. |
| **Scan issues (N) button** | ✅ | Non-modal ScanIssuesPane (QDialog) with 5-column table, Copy All button, and double-click-to-navigate. Delivered by #51. |
| **Modal dialog for hard errors** | ❌ MISSING | Prints to stderr and exits. |

## Summary — All Missing/Incomplete Items

### Tier 1 (Primary Workflow) Gaps — 11 items:

1. **Search bar not wired** — typing does nothing (`SearchIndex` never instantiated, `search_changed` signal not connected)
2. **Relative/Absolute toggle not visible** — no UI widget exists; `set_relative_mode()` is unreachable
3. **Rank badge colors** — #1 green, #2+ grey, losing red background — all unstyled plain text
4. **Expand/collapse animation sections** — `▾` is static decoration, no toggle/click logic
5. **Competitor rows not clickable** — can't focus a competitor to see its conditions
6. **Post-action toast** — no feedback after priority mutations
7. **Action buttons not disabled for warning items** — can attempt edits on broken submods
8. **Move to Top only submod scope** — replacer/mod scopes not wired to UI
9. **Details panel mostly empty** — mod/replacer show no data; submod missing disabled badge, description, filesystem path, condition summary, override source, EXTERNAL OVERRIDE badge
10. **Config not applied on startup** — relative/absolute, sort state, geometry, splitter positions all ignored; config never updated from UI state before save
11. **Clear Overrides button missing** — core `clear_override()` exists but nothing in UI calls it

### Tier 2 (Secondary Workflow) Gaps — 13 items:

12. **Formatted condition display** (REQUIRED / ONE OF / EXCLUDED three-bucket view)
13. **Formatted/Raw JSON toggle** in conditions panel header
14. **Sort toggle** (Priority / Name) in tree panel
15. **Shift to Priority N** button — core `shift()` exists but no UI
16. **Animation filter input** in stacks toolbar
17. **Collapse-winning button** in stacks toolbar
18. **Advanced filter builder** — stub only, no pill buckets
19. **Condition filter mode** detection in search bar
20. ~~**Scan issues (N) log pane** with file paths and error details~~ — ✅ delivered by #51
21. **EXTERNAL OVERRIDE badge** in details panel
22. **Manual directory picker** dialog on detection failure
23. **Keyboard focus on search bar at launch**
24. ~~**Warning items show parse errors in details panel** instead of generic text~~ — ✅ delivered by #51
